    whole page and it is very easy useful when we want to seperate the texts-->

    <!-- the <br> adds an empty space, and can be used in between text to 
    visually seperate them -->

    <!-- the <em> tag is used to itelicize the text and at the same time emphasize it
    in the page. it adds meaning to the page that this text has more importance
    the <i> tag is similar to the <em> tag, buy it does not add any meaning to the
    page, therefore, it is better to use <em> -->

    <!-- similar to <em> tag, the <strong> tag is used to make the text bold,
    <b> makes the text bold as well, but it is better to use <strong> -->
